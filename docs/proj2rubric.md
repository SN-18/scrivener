|.5|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing | |[Repo README](https://github.com/TommasU/scrivener)|
|.5|the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up  | |[Contributing](https://github.com/TommasU/scrivener/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)|

|.5|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) |3 |[Commits](https://github.com/TommasU/scrivener/graphs/commit-activity)|
|.5|evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base |3 |[Issues](https://github.com/TommasU/scrivener/issues). Available descriptions per file and methods.
|1|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)  |3 |[Source Code](https://github.com/TommasU/scrivener/tree/main/source)
|.5|Number of commits: by different people  | in GH|
|1|issues are being closed | evidence in GH|
|.5|issues are discussed before they are closed | even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
|.5|Use of syntax checkers. | config files iin GH showing this checker's config|
|1|Issues reports: there are many  | |
|.5|Use of code formatters. | config files in GH showing your this formatter's config|
|.5|Use of style checkers | config files in GH showing your config|
|.5|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. | |
|.5|test cases exist  | dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|
|.5|Use of code coverage  | config files in GH|
|.5|other automated analysis tools  | config files in GH|
|.5|test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases. | if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|.5|test cases are routinely executed | e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|

Please contact the group whose work you are extending. Ask from their grading rubric and its scores.
If that grading show any problem areas, you need to fix them (otherwise you will lose marks this time around).
